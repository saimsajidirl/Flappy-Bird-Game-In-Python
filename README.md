# Flappy-Bird-Game-In-Python
Recreate Flappy Bird in Python using Pygame! Control a bird (sprite) by pressing a key, navigate gaps between moving pipes (another sprite). Gravity pulls the bird down - avoid pipes and ground for high scores. This project teaches game development fundamentals: game loops, event handling, animation, collision detection, and basic physics
